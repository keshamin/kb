Concept Drift: The &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; of taking the decision evolved
Software Engineering Issues # Realtime or Batch Cloud or Edge Resources Requirements Latency/Throughput requirements Logging Security and Privacy Common Deployment Cases # New product Automate/assist with manual task Replace previous ML system Deployment modes # Shadow mode ML system works in parallel with current solution (manual or previous automated system) ML system&amp;rsquo;s decisions are not taken into account at this point Monitoring system compares results from both systems to estimate accuracy and probably collect more training data Canary deployment ML system works in parallel with current solution New system handles a small portion of traffic, e.</description></item></channel></rss>
